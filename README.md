##  CryptoClustering

This project uses clustering techniques to analyze cryptocurrency market data. It leverages machine learning techniques, including K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to identify patterns in the data.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Visualization of cryptocurrency market trends with `hvplot`
- K-Means clustering for market segmentation
- Dimensionality reduction with PCA

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas hvplot scikit-learn
```

## Data

The dataset used in this project is `crypto_market_data.csv`, which contains market data for various cryptocurrencies.

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` to:

1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Perform clustering analysis using K-Means.
3. Visualize the results.

## Output

- Clustered data visualizations
- Summary statistics
- PCA-transformed data representations
